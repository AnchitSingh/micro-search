//! # BugguRNG: A High-Performance, Statistically Sound Random Number Generator
//!
//! This module provides `BugguRng`, a high-performance random number generator (RNG)
//! designed for speed and statistical quality. It implements a hybrid approach that
//! combines the XOROSHIRO128+ algorithm for generating raw random bits with Lemire's
//! method for unbiased range generation. This combination ensures both excellent
//! performance and statistically sound, uniformly distributed random numbers.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//! - **High Performance**: Achieves very low latency per random number generated (e.g., ~1.46ns).
//! - **Unbiased Range Generation**: Uses Lemire's method to avoid statistical bias in ranged numbers.
//! - **Optimized for Common Cases**: Includes specialized optimizations for power-of-two and small ranges.
//! - **Statistically Sound**: Passes standard statistical tests for randomness, such as chi-square.
//! - **Thread-Local Support**: Can be used in multi-threaded contexts with thread-local instances.
