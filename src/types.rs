//! # Core Data Types
//!
//! This module defines the fundamental data types and structures used throughout the
//! LogDB system. These types provide a consistent and efficient representation for
//! key entities such as tokens, document IDs, and log entries.

/// Represents a token, which is a fundamental unit of information in the search index.
///
/// A token is typically a word, a phrase, or an attribute extracted from a log entry.
/// It is represented as a `u64` for efficient storage and lookup.
pub type Tok = u64;

/// A unique identifier for a document, which corresponds to a single log entry.
///
/// Each document in the database is assigned a unique `DocId` to allow for precise
/// retrieval and management.

/// Defines the tokenization mode for a log entry.
///
/// This enum allows for different strategies when processing log content, enabling
/// a balance between structured data extraction and full-text indexing.
